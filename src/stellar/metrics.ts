/**
 * RPC request timing metrics.
 *
 * The bot's only outbound calls are Soroban RPC `getHealth` and `getEvents`.
 * When either slows down or starts failing, an operator needs to see *that* and
 * roughly *how long* — from the scan output and the logs — without the metric
 * becoming a place a remote payload or a secret can land.
 *
 * The recorder keeps only fixed-size aggregates (per-operation request counts
 * and millisecond sums), never the request or response payloads, so memory is
 * O(1) in the number of requests and nothing sensitive is retained. The values
 * are wall-clock measurements of this process's own `await`, so they are safe to
 * log and to put in `/status`-style output.
