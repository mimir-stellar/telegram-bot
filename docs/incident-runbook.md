# Incident Runbook

Operational guidance for recovering the Mimir Telegram notifier from missed notifications, without treating Telegram as the source of truth.

## Operating principles

* Stellar chain state is the source of truth.
* The notifier is read-only and never holds signing keys or private keys.
* A notification failure must not alter on-chain state.
* Cursors must only move according to the poller's existing persistence rules.
* Logs and status output must not expose bot tokens, private keys, payment proofs, or unbounded remote payloads.
  Scrubbing is centralized in `src/redact.ts` (regression suite: `tests/redaction.test.mjs`).

Notification text from contract String fields is bounded to 200 Unicode code
points before MarkdownV2 escaping. An oversized or malformed transaction hash
does not receive an explorer link. The original event is still decoded and the
cursor follows the normal poller rules; truncation affects only the Telegram
presentation, not chain data or persisted cursor state.

## Quick health check

Run:

```bash
/health
```

Or for full poller state details:

```bash
/status
```

Check:

* overall readiness and status (`ok`, `degraded`, `stopped`)
* current chain tip
* RPC retained-history floor
* watched contract IDs
* last event ledger per contract
* persisted cursor
* poll/send counters
* last error and consecutive failure count

For a read-only chain diagnostic without a Telegram token:

```bash
npm run scan
```

Use `--from`, `--pages`, or `--show` when a narrower or deeper scan is needed.

## Operator pause and resume

`/pause` and `/resume` require the numeric user id configured in
`OPERATOR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID`. A notification chat id is not authorization because
all members of a group can send commands there. Unauthorized attempts receive no
reply and do not change polling.

`/pause` cancels the next scheduled cycle. A cycle already reading events or
retrying Telegram may finish under its existing bounded limits and normal cursor
rules. `/resume` is idempotent and schedules the next cycle immediately; it does
not rewind, reset, or replay cursors and cannot recover messages already dropped
after Telegram failures.

Pause state is process-local. A restart always begins polling while loading the
existing version-1 cursor file, preventing a stale pause from surviving a deploy.
An operator pause is reported as healthy by `/health` with `poller.paused=true`.

## RPC failures

### Symptoms

* `/status` reports a recent RPC error.
* One contract stops advancing while the other continues.
* Notifications from one contract are missing.

### Recovery

1. Confirm the RPC endpoint is reachable.
2. Run `npm run scan` to verify that the chain reader can access retained events.
3. Check the retained-history floor reported by the RPC.
4. Restart the process only if the underlying RPC problem has been resolved.

The affected contract's cursor is left unchanged after a failed scan, so the next polling cycle can retry from the same position. If the operator intentionally used `/pause`, use `/resume` only after the RPC is healthy; otherwise normal polling already retries on schedule.

Do not manually advance the cursor to skip an RPC failure.

## Telegram failures

### Symptoms

* Event scanning continues but sends fail.
* `/status` shows send errors or an increasing scan/send difference.
* The bot was removed from the chat or its token was revoked.

### Recovery

1. Confirm the bot token and chat configuration are valid.
2. Confirm the bot is still present in the target chat and has permission to post.
3. Use `/status` to confirm the process is still running and not intentionally paused.
4. Restart only when configuration has been corrected. If polling was deliberately paused, use `/resume` after the token/chat is healthy.

Telegram delivery is intentionally lossy. The poller commits the opaque cursor
after processing the returned page, even when sends are partial. A failed send
does not hold the cursor back because replaying every missed notification could
create an unbounded backlog or flood a recovered chat. The log reports the
sent/failed/skipped counts for that commit.

The Stellar chain remains the authoritative record.

## Stale or corrupt cursor

### Symptoms

* The cursor cannot be parsed.
* The stored cursor is incompatible with the current cursor format.
* The process reports a cursor-loading problem.

### Recovery

A corrupt cursor is treated as a cold start. A syntactically valid cursor that
Soroban rejects as stale is different: the poller keeps it unchanged, exposes
the bounded RPC error in `/status`, and retries the same position. `/resume`
also leaves it unchanged. This avoids duplicate notifications or skipped chain
history from a guessed reset.

Before changing `CURSOR_FILE` or deleting persisted state, preserve the existing file for investigation if possible.

If the stored cursor is confirmed incompatible or permanently outside RPC retention, stop the notifier, preserve the cursor file for investigation, and deliberately perform a cold start with the configured `START_LOOKBACK_LEDGERS` after checking the retained-history floor. This may produce duplicate notifications, but it does not skip or replay all retained history.

On a cold start, the poller begins from its configured lookback rather than replaying the entire retained RPC history.

Never replace a cursor with an arbitrary ledger or cursor value unless the repository's cursor format and retained-history requirements have been verified. `/pause` and `/resume` are safe alternatives because they leave the version-1 cursor file untouched.

## Process restart

### Persistent deployment

Ensure `data/` or the path configured by `CURSOR_FILE` is on persistent storage.

After a restart:

1. Check `/status`.
2. Confirm the persisted cursor is present.
3. Confirm polling resumes normally.
4. Check that counters and last-event ledgers begin advancing again.

### Ephemeral deployment

If the filesystem is ephemeral, every restart behaves like a cold start. Events that occurred while the process was down may not be posted.

Use persistent storage for long-running deployments.

## Rate limiting

Notification bursts are bounded by `MAX_NOTIFICATIONS_PER_CYCLE` and spaced out.

If Telegram rate limits are observed:

1. Confirm the process remains alive.
2. Check `/status` for send errors.
3. Do not disable the notification cap to compensate.
4. Allow subsequent polling cycles to continue normally.

Do not manually replay large event ranges into Telegram.

## Malformed or unexpected events

A malformed event must not crash the long-running process.

`decodeEvent` converts malformed XDR and events introduced by a newer contract
deployment into a bounded `unknown` record. The poller logs only the contract,
event name, ledger, and a clipped reason, skips Telegram delivery for that
event, and continues with the RPC cursor returned by the scan. This protects
the long-running reader while preserving the chain as the source of truth.

When investigating:

1. Use `npm run scan` to inspect the affected event range.
2. Confirm the contract and ledger involved.
3. Check the decoded event output without copying unrestricted remote payloads into logs or tickets.
4. Preserve the existing cursor behavior.

Do not modify on-chain state or attempt to repair an event by writing to the Mimir contracts.

## Safe rollback

For a deployment containing only documentation or operational changes:

1. Stop the affected deployment according to its hosting platform's procedure; use `/pause` only to stop scheduling while leaving the process available.
2. Revert to the previously known-good application revision.
3. Preserve the persistent `data/` volume.
4. Restart the known-good revision.
5. Check `/status`.
6. Verify that the persisted cursor is still present and polling resumes.

Do not delete cursor state as part of a normal rollback.

## Deployment checklist

Before deployment:

* `.env` contains valid configuration without exposing secrets in source control.
* `BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are supplied through the deployment secret/configuration mechanism.
* `data/` or `CURSOR_FILE` is persistent.
* The deployed revision passes typecheck and build checks.
* No production credentials are committed.

After deployment:

* Confirm the process starts successfully.
* Run `/status`.
* Confirm the expected contract IDs and cursor are shown.
* Confirm the last event ledger advances after new events.
* Monitor RPC and Telegram errors.

## Security and logging

Never log:

* Telegram bot tokens
* private keys or signing material
* payment proofs
* unrestricted remote API responses
* sensitive authentication data

When reporting an incident, include only the minimum information needed to identify the failure, such as contract, ledger, cursor state, error category, and timestamp.

## Rehearsing locally (mock profile)

Every failure mode in this runbook can be drilled on a laptop against the
local mock profile — loopback only, no bot token, no Testnet, and an isolated
`data/cursor.mock.json` that never overlaps a real bot's cursor:

```bash
npm run mock:poll -- --fail-events error   # RPC failure drill (see "RPC failures")
npm run mock:poll -- --stale-cursor        # stale cursor drill (see "Stale or corrupt cursor")
npm run mock:poll -- --malformed           # undecodable event drill
npm run mock:poll                          # healthy dry run; sends are logged, not delivered
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/health | jq .status
```

Injected failures last until the process stops, so recovery is "restart without
the flag": the cursor must resume exactly where it was, log lines stay bounded,
and no token-shaped secret appears anywhere in the output. The same guarantees
are asserted by `tests/mock-rpc.test.mjs` (`npm run test:mock`).

## Verification

Before merging operational changes, run the repository's documented checks:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
```

Also verify the command-level diagnostic path where applicable:

```bash
npm run scan
```

The notifier should remain read-only throughout incident recovery. The chain remains the source of truth even when Telegram delivery is unavailable.
