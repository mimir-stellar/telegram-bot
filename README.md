# Mimir Telegram bot

A Telegram notifier for [Mimir](https://github.com/mimir-stellar), the AI-settled
prediction market on Stellar. It polls Mimir's two Soroban contracts for new
on-chain events and posts them, human-readable, into a chat or channel:

```

```

Built with [grammy](https://grammy.dev) and
[`@stellar/stellar-sdk`](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk). Reads only —
it holds no keys and signs nothing.

## What it watches

| Contract | Events it notifies on |
|---|---|
| `mimir-market` | `claim_created`, `claim_challenged`, `claim_resolved`, `claim_cancelled`, `market_settled`, `challenger_paid`, `fee_claimed`, `withdrawal`, `withdrawal_pending` |
| `mimir-squad` | `market_created`, `deposited`, `withdrawn`, `resolved`, `claimed`, `fees_claimed` |

Admin events (`oracle_changed`, `ownership_transferred`, `fee_policy_*`,
`fee_accrued`, `agent_attributed`) are decoded far enough to be recognised and
then skipped — they are logged, not posted.

## Setup

### 1. Get a bot token

Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram, send `/newbot`, follow
the prompts, and copy the token it gives you (`123456789:AA…`).

### 2. Get the chat id

- **Private chat:** message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot); it replies
  with your numeric id.
- **Group:** add your bot to the group, send any message, then open
  `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates` and read
  `result[].message.chat.id`. Group and supergroup ids are negative
  (`-1001234567890`).
- **Channel:** add the bot as an administrator with "Post messages" permission.
  Either use the numeric id from `getUpdates` or, for a public channel, the
  `@channelusername`.

If your group has [privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#privacy-mode)
on (the default), the bot only sees messages that are commands or replies to it —
which covers `/status` and the operator controls below.

### 3. Choose an operator (optional)

Set `OPERATOR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID` to the numeric **user** id returned by
`@userinfobot` to enable `/pause` and `/resume`. The notification
`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` is intentionally not accepted as authorization: in a group,
everyone can send messages from that chat. If this variable is omitted, existing
deployments continue unchanged and both operator commands are ignored.

### 4. Configure and run

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # then fill in BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
npm install
npm run dev              # tsx, restarts on change
```

For production (Node):

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

For production (Docker):

```bash
docker build -t mimir-telegram-bot .
docker run -d \
  --name mimir-bot \
  --env-file .env \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  mimir-telegram-bot
```

`.env.example` ships with the live Stellar Testnet contract ids, so the only two
values you must supply are `BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. Every other
variable is documented inline there. A missing or malformed value aborts startup
with all the problems listed at once — the bot never boots into a state where it
looks healthy but notifies nobody.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/start` | What the bot is |
| `/help` | Same, plus the command list |
| `/status` | Chain tip, the RPC's retained-history floor, both watched contract ids, the last ledger an event was seen in per contract, the persisted cursor, poll/send counters and the last error |
| `/contracts` | The two contract ids this bot watches (`mimir-market`, `mimir-squad`) and a [stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert) link for each. Reads only from config, so it answers the same during a cold start, a run of RPC failures, or between restarts — unlike `/status`, there is nothing here that can be "unhealthy" |
| `/preview` | Previews channel notification formatting for `mimir-market` or `mimir-squad` without affecting cursors or poller state |
| `/pause` | Operator only. Stops scheduling new poll cycles; a scan already in progress may finish and persist its normal cursor |
| `/resume` | Operator only. Schedules the next poll cycle immediately, without changing or replaying cursors |

Commands from a user other than `OPERATOR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID` receive no control
response and cannot mutate poller state. Repeated `/pause` or `/resume` commands
are idempotent. Control state is process-local: a restart resumes polling and
loads the existing version-1 cursor file.

## Reading events without a bot token

The chain reader runs standalone. Testnet's Soroban RPC is public and
unauthenticated, so this needs nothing but the contract ids:

```bash
npm run scan                     # both contracts, from the RPC's retained floor
npm run scan -- --pages 40       # walk further
npm run scan -- --show 20        # print 20 decoded events per contract
npm run scan -- --from 4226500   # explicit start ledger
npm run scan -- --json           # one mimir-scan-v1 JSON document on stdout
npm run scan -- --json --show 20 # JSON including 20 decoded events per contract
```

Human mode prints the ledger window, an event-name histogram, and the decoded
payloads. With `--json`, stdout is a single `mimir-scan-v1` document (bigints as
decimal strings) and progress goes to stderr, so `npm run scan -- --json | jq`
stays valid. Neither mode prints bot tokens or signing keys — the scanner never
holds them. This is how the decoder was verified against the live deployment.

## Local mock profile

`MIMIR_PROFILE=mock` (or the scanner's `--mock` flag) fills in any config value
the environment leaves unset with a **local, loopback-only** Soroban mock:
fixture contract ids, `http://127.0.0.1:8420` RPC, and an isolated cursor file
at `data/cursor.mock.json` so a drill can never touch the real bot's position.
Explicit environment variables always win, any other profile name fails fast at
startup, and nothing here needs a bot token, Telegram credentials, or Testnet.

```bash
npm run mock:rpc                        # serve the fixture scenario on 127.0.0.1:8420
npm run scan:mock                       # scanner --mock: decode the scenario, no credentials
npm run mock:poll                       # dry run: mock RPC + real poller, sends are logged
npm run mock:poll -- --fail-events error  # inject in-band JSON-RPC failures
npm run mock:rpc -- --stale-cursor      # reject cursors once the poller has one
npm run mock:poll -- --malformed        # append an undecodable event (must skip, not crash)
npm run mock:poll -- --port 0           # ephemeral port (any entry point accepts it)
```

Failure kinds are `error`, `http-500`, `rate-limit`, and `stale-cursor`, with
the shorthands `--fail-rpc`, `--rate-limit`, `--stale-cursor` for `getEvents`
and `--fail-health <kind>` for `getHealth`. The mock enforces the real RPC's
request rules — mutually exclusive `startLedger`/`cursor`, the retained floor as
an error rather than an empty page, bounded error messages — and the dry run
exercises the poller's cursor-safety, restart, and bounded-log guarantees end to
end. `npm test` covers all of it (`tests/mock-*.test.mjs`); run just those with
`npm run test:mock`.

## How the polling works

Soroban's `getEvents` is **not** `eth_getLogs`, and the difference is the whole
design of `src/stellar/events.ts`:

- Paging is by **opaque cursor**, not block range, so the walk is inherently
  sequential — there is no chunk fan-out to parallelise.
- `startLedger`/`endLedger` and `cursor` are **mutually exclusive** in one
  request.
- The RPC keeps only a **rolling window** of events (~120,960 ledgers, roughly a
  week, on Testnet). A `startLedger` below the retained floor is an *error*, not
  an empty result, so the floor is clamped from `getHealth()` first.
- **An empty page does not mean the scan is finished.** One request covers a
  bounded slice of ledgers and returns whatever was in it — frequently nothing —
  plus a cursor to continue from. Terminating on a short page (the correct
  instinct for `eth_getLogs`) silently yields zero events. Verified against the
  live deployment: reading the market contract from the retained floor takes 13
  pages, 12 of which are empty, to reach the page holding all 11 of its events.

So the walk terminates on the cursor, never on the payload.

Events are also not a source of truth for current state — a claim's stakes and
status come from the contract's own getters. This bot is a timeline, not an
index.

## Decoder compatibility contract

The decoder is deliberately forward-compatible at the event boundary:

- Soroban event topics are read in declaration order, and non-topic fields are
  read from the event value map using their deployed snake_case names.
- A known event with a malformed topic, value, address, integer, or XDR value
  becomes an `unknown` event. `decodeEvent` never throws into the poller, so one
  bad event cannot stop a scan or move a cursor based on a partial payload.
- Events that are valid on-chain but unknown to this version are retained as
  `unknown` for bounded logs and are skipped for Telegram. They are not
  invented, retried, or treated as current contract state.
- Amounts remain `bigint` atomic USDC values until formatting; no floating-point
  conversion is used. Contract strings are clipped at the notification and
  diagnostic boundaries, and scanner output is bounded.

The compatibility promise is for the deployed event wire shape and the public
decoded payload names above, not for arbitrary XDR or future contract fields.
Adding an optional field is safe when the existing fields retain their names
and types. Renaming a topic or changing a field type is a decoder compatibility
change and must be deployed together with a recorded fixture and an operational
note. The chain remains authoritative if the bot version cannot decode an event.

RPC configuration is read-only: `STELLAR_RPC_URL` must point to a Soroban RPC
endpoint, and `STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` controls network labeling for
explorer links. The client sends no signing material and creates no wallet.
Explorer path components are URL-encoded; custom `STELLAR_EXPLORER_BASE_URL`
values are supported without changing cursor or decoder compatibility.

## Cursor persistence

The poller writes its resume position to `data/cursor.json` (write-then-rename,
so a crash mid-write cannot truncate it):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "updatedAt": "2026-08-21T10:00:00.000Z",
  "targets": {
    "market": { "cursor": "0018276211125911551-4294967295", "lastEventLedger": 4226729 },
    "squad":  { "cursor": "0018276211125911551-4294967295", "lastEventLedger": 4226733 }
  }
}
```

On a cold start (no file) it begins `START_LOOKBACK_LEDGERS` behind the chain tip
rather than replaying the whole retained window into your chat. `/pause` and
`/resume` never edit this file; they only control scheduling, so the cursor
format remains version 1 and a restart does not preserve a pause.

Tests never use this directory: they run against an ephemeral data directory
created under the OS temp dir and removed afterwards (see
[docs/contributor-fixtures.md](docs/contributor-fixtures.md)).

**Deployment note:** a flat file is fine for v0 but it must survive restarts. On
an always-on host, put `data/` on a persistent volume (or point `CURSOR_FILE`
at one). On an ephemeral filesystem every restart is a cold start, and events
that happened while the bot was down are never posted. Swapping this for a real
KV store is a deliberate future step, not something this repo does today.

## Failure behaviour

This process is meant to stay up for weeks, so a single failure never ends it:

- **A failed RPC call** fails one contract's scan for one cycle. Its cursor is
  left untouched, so the next cycle resumes exactly where it stopped.
- **A partial notification batch** commits the opaque RPC cursor after the
  returned page has been processed. Unknown events, events beyond
  `MAX_NOTIFICATIONS_PER_CYCLE`, and sends that exhaust three bounded retries
  are counted as skipped or failed and are not replayed. Holding the cursor
  back would turn a revoked token or removed chat into an infinite replay, and
  recovery would flood the channel. Notifications are lossy on purpose — the
  chain is the record; the poller logs the sent/failed/skipped commit decision.
- **A corrupt cursor file** is treated as a cold start rather than a crash. A
  valid but RPC-rejected stale cursor is never silently rewound: the target keeps
  that cursor, the error becomes visible in `/status`, and scheduled retries or
  `/resume` use the same position. Recovery follows the incident runbook rather
  than replacing an opaque cursor with a guessed ledger.
- **A burst** is capped at `MAX_NOTIFICATIONS_PER_CYCLE` messages per cycle,
  spaced out, so Telegram's rate limiter is never the thing that takes the bot
  down. RPC, Telegram, and poller error text shown in `/status` or logs is
  compact, bounded, and the configured bot token is redacted.
- **An operator pause** prevents new cycles but cannot cancel a bounded scan or
  Telegram retry loop already in progress. That cycle follows the normal cursor
  rules above; `/resume` starts the next cycle immediately.

## Long-running operation

The notifier is meant to run for weeks through Stellar RPC and Telegram outages.
Everything it keeps in memory is fixed-size or capped:

- Per-target state is two small records (cursor, last event ledger, last error).
- A scan walks at most 20 event pages, and each cycle sends at most
  `MAX_NOTIFICATIONS_PER_CYCLE` messages; the rest are counted as skipped.
- Error text is redacted (bot token) and clipped before it reaches `/status`,
  `/health`, or logs; unknown or malformed events are logged as one bounded line.
- At most one poll timer is pending, and `stop()` leaves none behind.

`tests/soak.test.mjs` enforces this offline: it drives about 1,700 poll cycles
through a scripted fake RPC (outages, stale-cursor rejections, malformed and
unknown events) with every Telegram send failing, under mocked timers. It asserts
that heap growth after a forced GC stays under 4 MB, that status and every log
line stay bounded and token-free, and that timers do not accumulate. A control
test deliberately leaks per send and must trip the same threshold, so the check
cannot silently stop working. It needs no Testnet, Telegram credentials, or keys.

**Deployment assumptions:** one process per chat and cursor file (two writers
would race on `CURSOR_FILE`), the cursor path on persistent storage, and a
supervisor that restarts the process and probes `GET /health`. If you suspect a
leak in production, watch the process RSS over days; a restart is always safe.

**Rollback:** deploy the previous build and start it against the same
`CURSOR_FILE`. The cursor format is unchanged (version 1) and the chain is the
source of truth, so nothing is replayed beyond the last saved cursor and nothing
needs migrating. Keep a copy of the cursor file if you want an exact resume point.

## Health endpoint

The process exposes a **loopback HTTP** probe for supervisors and deploy
checks (default `http://127.0.0.1:8787`):

| Path | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health` (alias `/healthz`) | Readiness-style status. `200` when the poller is running and healthy, including an intentional operator pause; `503` when stopped or degraded (repeated RPC failures or a stale success window). The response includes `poller.paused`. |
| `GET /health/live` (alias `/livez`) | Liveness only — the process and HTTP server are up. Always `200` while listening. |

The JSON body is operational status only: poller counters, ledgers, truncated
cursors, and whether a target has an error. It never includes `BOT_TOKEN`,
chat ids, private keys, or unbounded remote payloads.

Configuration (see `.env.example`):

- `HEALTH_HOST` — bind address (default `127.0.0.1`; set to `0.0.0.0` for Docker)
- `HEALTH_PORT` — TCP port (default `8787`; `0` disables)
- `HEALTH_STALE_MS` — degraded if no successful poll within this window after the first success (default `90000`; `0` disables)

**Rollback:** set `HEALTH_PORT=0` (or omit the new env keys to keep defaults) and
redeploy the previous image — the health module is additive and does not change
cursor format or Telegram behaviour.

**Failure modes:** binding fails only if the port is already taken (process
exits via the listen error path after logging). Client disconnects and probe
errors are logged and ignored so they cannot stop the notifier.

## Development checks

Run `npm run typecheck` for a no-emit TypeScript check, `npm test` for the build plus the deterministic command, poller, format, fixture, health and lockfile suites, or `npm run build` to produce the production output. CI runs typecheck, build, and all tests without network credentials.

### Lockfile reproducibility

`package-lock.json` is the install of record: deployments rebuild with `npm ci`,
so the committed lockfile must stay in sync with `package.json` and pin exactly
what it claims. Two checks enforce that, and CI runs both after `npm ci`:

- `npm run lockfile:check` — offline. The lockfile is `lockfileVersion` 3, its
  root entry matches `package.json`'s dependency ranges exactly, every package
  resolves to a `registry.npmjs.org` tarball with a `sha512` integrity hash, and
  every direct dependency is pinned at the top level. Drift is reported by
  package name instead of being silently re-resolved.
- `npm run lockfile:reproduce` — asks npm to regenerate the lockfile from itself
  in a scratch directory and fails if the resolved package set changes, so a
  hand-edited or partially-resolved lockfile cannot land. The repository working
  tree is never written to.

The offline suite runs as part of `npm test` (`tests/lockfile.test.mjs`), so
drift is caught locally without network access. To change dependencies, edit
`package.json`, run `npm install` to regenerate the lockfile, and commit both
files together — a lockfile that no longer matches `package.json` fails
`npm ci`, `npm run lockfile:check`, and CI.
Run `npm run typecheck` for a no-emit TypeScript check, `npm test` for the build plus the deterministic command, poller, format, fixture, mock-profile and health suites (`npm run test:mock` for just the local-mock suites), or `npm run build` to produce the production output. CI runs typecheck, build, and all tests without network credentials.

Contributor workflow for credential-free fixtures (event catalogs, cursor samples, failure-mode expectations) lives in [docs/contributor-fixtures.md](docs/contributor-fixtures.md). Automated tests never require live Testnet RPC access, Telegram credentials, or signing keys.
